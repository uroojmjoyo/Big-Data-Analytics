Running Linux inside a docker container and show execution of Linux commands (also show the memory usage)

Pull a Docker image:

docker pull busybox 
docker images 
docker run busybox
docker ps (ps means “Process Status”, so docker ps basically shows all of the Docker processes actively running)
docker ps –a (all)

Start a Docker container from the image:

docker run –it busybox /bin/sh (creates interactive bash shell in the container)

Now after being inside the Docker container and we can run any Linux command, for example:

Ls (list files and directories. The contents of your current working directory)
pwd (prints the current working directory path)
uptime (Tell how long the Linux system has been running.)

We can then exit the container by typing: 

exit.
 
Running an RDBMS (mysql and postgres ) inside a container, put some data in it, and run 2-3 SQL commands (Bonus) 

Star off by pull the latest image for MySQL from the Docker Hub:

docker pull mysql

Run a container from the image:

docker run -d --name sqlmy -e MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD=sqlpwd mysql

-d (means detached mode where the container runs in the bg and we use the terminal for other commands)

Connect to the running container and access the database:

docker exec -it sqlmy mysql -uroot -p

Now after access to database, we can create a database, a table, and insert some data:

CREATE DATABASE universityrecord; 
USE universityrecord;
Create Table Students (Student_ID int, Name varchar(50), Program varchar(50));
INSERT INTO Students VALUES (4872, "Cillian John", ‘BS Economics’);

Running SQL commands to query the data we just inserted:

SELECT * FROM Students;
SELECT Student_ID FROM Students;
